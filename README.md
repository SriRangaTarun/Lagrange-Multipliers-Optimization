# Lagrange-Multipliers-Optimization
In this project, I implemented the Lagrange Multipliers optimization method, which uses gradients to optimize multivariable functions under constraints, using the SymPy library in Python. I show how it can be used to optimize the volume of a box with surface area constraints.
